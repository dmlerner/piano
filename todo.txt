to generate SoT
	just play
	but run it through a rythm aligner
	that knows everything is on some sixteenth note
		or whatever
		eg if there's triplets and sixteenths, might have to do 12ths of a beat
	do it for each hand separately?
teamviewer to android
	works
visualizer
	roll my own?
		because lillypond etc  will be slow
		because they don't incrementally generate png
	start with pylab for easy prototyping
		fuck frontend works

one thread updates pylab png view
	svg?
one thread modifies colors
	takes raw notation
	runs backend to determine colors
	converts to music21
	calls lily to make png

to get svg with rgb
	set note color to my custom strings
	stream.write('lily.ly', FILENAME)
	delete preamble bullshit
		which will make it always output pdf
