to generate SoT
	just play
	but run it through a rythm aligner
	that knows everything is on some sixteenth note
		or whatever
		eg if there's triplets and sixteenths, might have to do 12ths of a beat
	do it for each hand separately?
teamviewer to android
	works
visualizer
	roll my own
	because lillypond etc  will be slow
	because they don't incrementally generate png
show SoT left hand
